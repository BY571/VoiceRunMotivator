# Privacy Policy for Pacemaker

**Last updated:** February 4, 2026

## Overview

Pacemaker is a GPS-based running pace tracker. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app accesses and how it is handled.

## Data Collection

Pacemaker does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. The app operates entirely on your device.

### Location Data

- Pacemaker accesses your device's GPS location **only during an active run** to calculate distance and pace.
- Location data is processed in real-time on your device and is **not stored** after the run ends.
- Location data is **never** sent to any server, third party, or external service.
- Background location access is used solely to continue tracking your run when the screen is off or the app is in the background.

### Settings

- Your preferences (feedback intervals, trigger mode) are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage.
- These settings never leave your device.

## Data Sharing

Pacemaker does **not** share any data with third parties. There are no analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking frameworks in the app.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions, all of which are required for core functionality:

| Permission | Purpose |
